Question = (Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.)

solution
----------
assumption = #for x%7 = 0 and x%5 != 0 between range(2000,3201) create a list my_list = []

my_list = []
for x in range(2000,3201):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5!=0):
        my_list.append(x)
        print (my_list[-1],end=',')

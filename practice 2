Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320






num = 8

factorial = 1

if num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    for i in range(1,num + 1):
        factorial = factorial*i
    print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)
    
    
    explanation:
    
    the if statement confirms that the num variable is not zero and then the else checks for the numbers using the range function then assigns a new 
    value to the factorial and for every iteration it multiplies the new favtorial with the old within the range.
